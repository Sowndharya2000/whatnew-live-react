sell, Sellers should honor any buyer refund requests but can continue to sell \r\n        spots in future breaks (while respecting WhatNew’s shipping requirements) so long as the sealed product has not yet been opened. \r\n        Sellers can also contact Seller Support to ensure earlier purchases are canceled and refunded.\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <strong>No participants can be related to the seller:</strong> Individuals who are members of the same household, family members, \r\n        or seller’s employees may not enter a seller’s Card Break.\r\n      </li>\r\n
