<strong>Failure to ship:</strong> Items are not shipped or dropped\r\n              off within 2 business days of sale (8 business days for plants).\r\n              Sellers must ensure all packages are scanned by the carrier (one\r\n              scan from a SCAN sheet is not sufficient).\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <strong>High rate of lost items:</strong> Accounts
