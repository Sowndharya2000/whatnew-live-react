With safeguards in place to shield them from malicious behavior \r\n      and ensure timely payment for completed sales, sellers on WhatNew can confidently manage their business and focus on their goals.  \r\n      Below is an overview of seller responsibilities, protections, and eligibility guidelines to ensure you qualify for these protections.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>WhatNew Seller Protections</h3>\r\n    <p>WhatNew offers several protections to sellers:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><strong>Refund Abuse:</strong> WhatNew monitors buyer behavior for potential abuse across the platform. If a buyer is found abusing the system, you will not be responsible for that refund.</li>\r\n      <li><strong>Problems with Returned Items:</strong> If an item returned to you is not in the condition you originally shipped it, contact WhatNew Support for assistance.</li>\r\n      <li><strong>Chargebacks:</strong> Sellers are not responsible for chargebacks. If a buyer files a chargeback, they will not be eligible to receive a refund on that transaction.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <div className=\"note-1\">\r\n      <strong>Dispute Process:</strong>  \r\n      In the case of a dispute, WhatNew will investigate with relevant submitted information from both buyer and seller and make a balanced decision \r\n      based on which party followed the platform’s guidelines.\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      If you’ve purchased <strong>XCover Shipping Protection</strong>, please file your claim directly with XCover if the item got lost, stolen, or damaged in transit.  \r\n      See more information about XCover Protection in <em>Protecting your Shipments</em>.  \r\n      Please review the terms, conditions, and exclusions. Protection is provided by Cover Genius and powered by XCover.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Seller Responsibilities</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      As a seller, you are responsible for ensuring that all items are delivered to buyers in the condition described at the time of sale.  \r\n      If you meet this requirement, you will be paid by WhatNew for your order. However, you may be charged for refunds in the following situations:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><strong>Incomplete or incorrect items:</strong> One or more items are missing or incorrect.</li>\r\n      <li><strong>Item Not as Described or Inauthentic:</strong> Items received are damaged, expired, defective, counterfeit or fake, or do not match the condition description.</li>\r\n      <li><strong>Failure to ship:</strong> Items are not shipped or dropped off within 2 business days of sale (8 business days for plants).  \r\n        Sellers must ensure all packages are scanned by the carrier (one scan from a SCAN sheet is not sufficient).</li>\r\n      <li><strong>High rate of lost items:</strong> Accounts with an excessive number of missing or undelivered items may lose protection eligibility.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <div className=\"note-2\">\r\n      <strong>Appeal Process:</strong>  \r\n      If you believe a refund or return decision was made in error, you may file an appeal or dispute with WhatNew Support for review.\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Additional Details</h3>\r\n     </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{/*
