If there is an issue with an order, the original host’s account will be linked to that order. However, both accounts are subject to investigation and potential account action by our Trust & Safety teams if our community guidelines are not followed.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Who Fulfills the Orders from a Co-Hosted Live Show?</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      All orders made during a co-hosted live are the responsibility of the original host. All shipping labels are provided to the original host of the stream within the Seller Hub and not the co-host.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      If a co-host has items from their inventory sold during a live show, it is the responsibility of the original host to provide the shipping labels to the co-host and ensure the items are shipped.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>How to Send Labels to the Co-Host</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Once the live show is over, all labels will be present in the original host’s Seller Hub.</li>\r\n      <li>The original host should be able to generate the labels within their Seller Hub by selecting the show in which the co-host was present.</li>\r\n      <li>The host can download and email selected labels to the co-host.</li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <strong>Note:</strong> Any label sent to the co-host will have the original host’s address as the return address. If an item is returned or undeliverable, it will be sent back to the original host.\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Who Gets the Payout for the Orders Sold on a Co-Hosted Live?</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The original seller will receive all the funds from the show regardless of who shipped out the order.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>If I Was the Co-Host and Have Items That Were Sold in the Live</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The co-host will need to get the shipping labels from the original host, as all labels are located in the original host’s Seller Hub.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Can the Co-Host Sell Items in Their Marketplace?</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      No. If the co-host wants to sell items during the show, they must have the original seller list those items as part of their inventory prior to the show, or use the “Create Temporary Listing” feature during the stream.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{/* ===== Live Show Resources Section ===== */}\r\n<div
